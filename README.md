You can even combine screenshots together with some code and then ask related questions!

### 🔥 RAG Feature

**[📖 Full RAG Documentation](https://genie.devoxx.com/docs/rag)**

<img width="749" alt="RAG" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ea34247a-b33d-40a2-b96a-d10de0868dfa">

Devoxx Genie now includes starting from v0.4.0 a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) feature, which enables advanced code search and retrieval capabilities. 
This feature uses a combination of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms to analyze code snippets and identify relevant results based on their semantic meaning.

With RAG, you can:

* Search for code snippets using natural language queries
* Retrieve relevant code examples that match your query's intent
* Explore related concepts and ideas in the codebase

We currently use Ollama and Nomic Text embedding to generates vector representations of your project files.
These embedding vectors are then stored in a Chroma DB (v0.6.2) running locally within Docker. 
The vectors are used to compute similarity scores between search queries and your code all running locally.

The RAG feature is a significant enhancement to Devoxx Genie's code search capabilities, enabling developers to quickly find relevant code examples and accelerate their coding workflow.

See also [Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVU8x45jIt4)

Expecting to add also [GraphRAG](https://github.com/devoxx/DevoxxGenieIDEAPlugin/issues/474) in the near future.

### LLM Settings
In the IDEA settings you can modify the REST endpoints and the LLM parameters.  Make sure to press enter and apply to save your changes.

We now also support Cloud based LLMs, you can paste the API keys on the Settings page. 

<img width="1072" alt="Settings" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a88f1ae8-55dc-4c6b-b5eb-ec0c3d70b28f">

### Smart Model Selection and Cost Estimation
The language model dropdown is not just a list anymore, it's your compass for smart model selection.

<img width="698" height="295" alt="Opus46" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8174c0ad-3943-4c4c-aebd-4ba50c90d015" />

See available context window sizes for each cloud model
View associated costs upfront
Make data-driven decisions on which model to use for your project

### Add Project to prompt & clipboard

You can now add the full project to your prompt IF your selected cloud LLM has a big enough window context.

![AddFull](https://github.com/devoxx/DevoxxGenieIDEAPlugin/assets/179457/be014cf1-ee01-428a-bd75-55acc82627fb)

### Calc Cost

Leverage the prompt cost calculator for precise budget management. Get real-time updates on how much of the context window you're using.

![AddCalcProject](https://github.com/devoxx/DevoxxGenieIDEAPlugin/assets/179457/0c971331-40fe-47a4-8ede-f349fa40c00c)

See the input/output costs and window context per Cloud LLM.  Eventually we'll also allow you to edit these values.

![Cost](https://github.com/devoxx/DevoxxGenieIDEAPlugin/assets/179457/422fc829-fc9f-42f4-a8e5-c33ec5a239fc)

### Handling Massive Projects?
"But wait," you might say, "my project is HUGE!" 😅 

Fear not! We've got options:

1. Leverage Gemini's Massive Context: 

Gemini's colossal 1 million token window isn't just big, it's massive. We're talking about the capacity to digest approximately 30,000 lines of code in a single go. That's enough to digest most codebases whole, from the tiniest scripts to some decent projects.

But if that's not enough you have more options...

2. Smart Filtering: 

The new "Copy Project" panel lets you: 

Exclude specific directories 
Filter by file extensions
Remove JavaDocs to slim down your context

<img width="1072" alt="ScanProject" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/51523394-1b36-442b-adfa-91d0c7a8182e">

3. Selective Inclusion 

Right-click to add only the most relevant parts of your project to the context.

![RightClick](https://github.com/devoxx/DevoxxGenieIDEAPlugin/assets/179457/a86c311a-4589-41f9-bb4a-c8c4f0b884ee)

## The Power of Full Context: A Real-World Example
The DevoxxGenie project itself, at about 70K tokens, fits comfortably within most high-end LLM context windows. 
This allows for incredibly nuanced interactions – we're talking advanced queries and feature requests that leave tools like GitHub Copilot scratching their virtual heads!

## Support for JLama & LLama3.java
DevoxxGenie now also supports the 100% Modern Java LLM inference engines: [JLama](https://github.com/tjake/Jlama).

JLama offers a REST API compatible with the widely-used OpenAI API. Use the Custom OpenAI URL to connect.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/65096be3-2b34-4fea-8295-d63e04066390)

You can also integrate it seamlessly with [Llama3.java](https://github.com/stephanj/Llama3JavaChatCompletionService) but using the Spring Boot OpenAI API wrapper coupled with the JLama DevoxxGenie option.

## Local LLM Cluster with Exo

Use the custom OpenAI URL to connect to Exo, a local LLM cluster for Apple Silicon which allows you to run Llama 3.1 8b, 70b and 405b on your own Apple computers 🤩

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a79033ff-d9dd-442d-aa92-0fc70cc37747)

## Test Driven Generation (TDG) - Experimental

Write a unit test and let DevoxxGenie generated the implementation for that unit test. 
This approach was explained by Bouke Nijhuis in his [Devoxx Belgium presentation](https://youtu.be/YRFpyGbp6h4?si=mYzJuVRMnclZJMIM)

An demo on how to accomplish this can be seen in this 𝕏 [post](https://x.com/Stephan007/status/1854949507710198209).

### Understanding the Prompt Flow

The DevoxxGenie IDEA Plugin processes user prompts through the following steps:

### 1️⃣ User Inputs a Prompt
- [`UserPromptPanel`](https://github.com/devoxx/DevoxxGenieIDEAPlugin/blob/master/src/main/java/com/devoxx/genie/ui/panel/UserPromptPanel.java) → Captures the prompt from the UI.
- [`PromptSubmissionListener.onPromptSubmitted()`](https://github.com/devoxx/DevoxxGenieIDEAPlugin/blob/master/src/main/java/com/devoxx/genie/ui/listener/PromptSubmissionListener.java) → Listens for the submission event.
- [`PromptExecutionController.handlePromptSubmission()`](https://github.com/devoxx/DevoxxGenieIDEAPlugin/blob/master/src/main/java/com/devoxx/genie/controller/PromptExecutionController.java) → Starts execution.

### 2️⃣ Processing the Prompt
- [`PromptExecutionService.executeQuery()`](https://github.com/devoxx/DevoxxGenieIDEAPlugin/blob/master/src/main/java/com/devoxx/genie/service/PromptExecutionService.java) → Handles token usage calculations and checks RAG/GitDiff settings.
- [`ChatPromptExecutor.executePrompt()`](https://github.com/devoxx/DevoxxGenieIDEAPlugin/blob/master/src/main/java/com/devoxx/genie/service/ChatPromptExecutor.java) → Dispatches the prompt to the selected **LLM provider**.
- [`LLMProviderService.getAvailableModelProviders()`](https://github.com/devoxx/DevoxxGenieIDEAPlugin/blob/master/src/main/java/com/devoxx/genie/service/LLMProviderService.java) → Retrieves the appropriate model from `ChatModelFactory`.

### 3️⃣ LLM Model Inference
- [`ChatModelFactory.getModels()`](https://github.com/devoxx/DevoxxGenieIDEAPlugin/blob/master/src/main/java/com/devoxx/genie/chatmodel/ChatModelFactory.java) → Gets the models for the select LLM provider

### How to Get Started

- Start by **exploring [`PromptExecutionController.java`](https://github.com/devoxx/DevoxxGenieIDEAPlugin/blob/master/src/main/java/com/devoxx/genie/controller/PromptExecutionController.java)** to see how prompts are routed.
- Modify [`ChatResponsePanel.java`](https://github.com/devoxx/DevoxxGenieIDEAPlugin/blob/master/src/main/java/com/devoxx/genie/ui/panel/ChatResponsePanel.java) if you want to **enhance response rendering**.
- To **add a new LLM provider**, create a factory under [`chatmodel/cloud/`](https://github.com/devoxx/DevoxxGenieIDEAPlugin/blob/master/src/main/java/com/devoxx/genie/chatmodel/cloud/) or [`chatmodel/local/`](https://github.com/devoxx/DevoxxGenieIDEAPlugin/blob/master/src/main/java/com/devoxx/genie/chatmodel/local/).
