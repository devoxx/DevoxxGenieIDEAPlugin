**Vulnerability:** CVE-2025-69873
**Description:** ajv (Another JSON Schema Validator) through version 8.17.1 is vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) when the $data option is enabled. The pattern keyword accepts runtime data via JSON Pointer syntax ($data reference), which is passed directly to the JavaScript RegExp() constructor without validation. An attacker can inject a malicious regex pattern (e.g., "^(a|a)*$") combined with crafted input to cause catastrophic backtracking. A 31-character payload causes approximately 44 seconds of CPU blocking, with each additional character doubling execution time. This enables complete denial of service with a single HTTP request against any API using ajv with $data: true for dynamic schema validation.
**Package:** ajv@8.17.1
**Target:** docusaurus/package-lock.json
**Fix available:** Upgrade to ajv@8.18.0, 6.14.0

**Remediation:** Update the dependency to the fixed version or evaluate if the vulnerability applies to your usage.
