**Vulnerability:** CVE-2026-26996
**Description:** minimatch is a minimal matching utility for converting glob expressions into JavaScript RegExp objects. Versions 10.2.0 and below are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) when a glob pattern contains many consecutive * wildcards followed by a literal character that doesn't appear in the test string. Each * compiles to a separate [^/]*? regex group, and when the match fails, V8's regex engine backtracks exponentially across all possible splits. The time complexity is O(4^N) where N is the number of * characters. With N=15, a single minimatch() call takes ~2 seconds. With N=34, it hangs effectively forever. Any application that passes user-controlled strings to minimatch() as the pattern argument is vulnerable to DoS. This issue has been fixed in version 10.2.1.
**Package:** minimatch@3.1.2
**Target:** docusaurus/package-lock.json
**Fix available:** Upgrade to minimatch@10.2.1

**Remediation:** Update the dependency to the fixed version or evaluate if the vulnerability applies to your usage.
