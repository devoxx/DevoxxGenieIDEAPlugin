## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
All three "the run didn't finish normally" paths currently end in near-silence inside the conversation:

- **Stop**: clicking Stop calls `StreamingResponseHandler.stop()` which sets `isStopped`, cleans up, and hides the loading indicator — the spinner just vanishes. A response cut off mid-sentence is indistinguishable from a complete one.
- **Error**: `PromptErrorHandler.handleException()` fires a transient IntelliJ toast via `NotificationUtil` and the chat shows nothing. Once the toast fades, there is no record of what failed, and the user must re-type or re-submit manually.
- **Loop limit**: when `AgentLoopTracker` hits max tool calls it publishes `LOOP_LIMIT`, visible only in the Logs tool window. In chat the agent appears to simply give up.

Add a terminal-state model to the message UI:

1. Extend `MessageUiModel` with `terminalState: COMPLETED | STOPPED | ERROR | LOOP_LIMIT` (+ optional `errorText`).
2. **Stopped**: in the stop path, set STOPPED on the active message; `AiBubble.kt` renders a small muted footer "⏹ Stopped by user" under whatever partial text was kept.
3. **Inline error card with Retry**: on error, render a compact error block in the bubble (red-tinted background, error summary, "Retry" button). Retry re-submits the original user prompt with the same context — `ChatMessageContext` is still available at error time; route the retry through the same submission entry point (`PromptExecutionController.handlePromptSubmission()` flow) rather than a parallel path. Keep the existing toast for visibility, but the durable record lives in the chat.
4. **Loop limit**: subscribe to `LOOP_LIMIT` in `ConversationViewModel.onActivityMessage()` and set the LOOP_LIMIT terminal state, rendered as "Reached max tool calls (N) — you can raise the limit in Settings → Agent" with a link/affordance that opens the Agent settings page.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Stopping a streaming response leaves a visible "Stopped by user" marker on that message; partial text remains exactly as before (memory cleanup behavior unchanged)
- [x] #2 A failed prompt shows an inline error card in the conversation with a human-readable summary; the card persists across scrolling (it is part of the message model, not an overlay)
- [x] #3 The error card's Retry button re-submits the same prompt with the same attached context exactly once per click, using the normal submission flow (buttons disable, indicator shows, etc.)
- [x] #4 Hitting the agent loop limit shows an in-chat notice naming the configured limit, with an affordance that opens Settings → Agent
- [x] #5 Terminal states are mutually exclusive and final per message: a stopped message cannot later flip to completed by a straggling token (isStopped guard already blocks updates — assert it)
- [x] #6 Restored conversations from history render terminal markers gracefully (persisted conversations without the field default to COMPLETED; no crash on old data)
- [x] #7 Unit tests: stop mid-stream sets STOPPED and blocks further partials; error path sets ERROR with message; LOOP_LIMIT event sets state; retry invokes the submission entry point with the original prompt

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
- Wire stop through the existing chain: `PromptExecutionController.stopPromptExecution()` → `StreamingResponseHandler.stop()` already runs on a known context; add a `conversationViewController` callback there (same pattern as `hideLoadingIndicator`).
- Error text: reuse whatever `PromptErrorHandler` already derives for the toast — do not build a second classification layer. Truncate long provider stack traces; full detail stays in idea.log.
- Retry must guard against double-submission (disable the button after click) and against retrying while another prompt is executing.
- Persistence: check what `ConversationStorageService` stores per message before persisting terminalState; if schema change is non-trivial, keeping terminal state session-only is acceptable for v1 — note the decision in this task on completion.
- Non-streaming mode (`NonStreamingPromptExecutionService`) has its own completion path; make sure STOPPED/ERROR are set there too, not only in `StreamingResponseHandler`.
- Synergy: task-233's status line should clear when any terminal state is set.
- Out of scope: automatic retries/backoff, error categorization UI, partial-response regeneration ("continue").

## Final Summary

<!-- SECTION:FINAL_SUMMARY:BEGIN -->
Implemented in PR #1107 (https://github.com/devoxx/DevoxxGenieIDEAPlugin/pull/1107), approved 2026-06-10, pending merge. `MessageUiModel` gained a `TerminalState` enum (COMPLETED|STOPPED|ERROR|LOOP_LIMIT) plus errorText/loopLimitMaxCalls/retryAttempted; states are mutually exclusive and final per message. Stop (streaming and non-streaming) renders a "⏹ Stopped by user" footer with partial text kept; errors render a red-tinted inline card with a one-shot Retry routed through PROMPT_SUBMISSION_TOPIC → the normal handlePromptSubmission flow; AgentLoopTracker now publishes LOOP_LIMIT regardless of the debug-logs setting and the chat shows "Reached max tool calls (N)" with a link opening Settings → Agent Mode. All `setTerminalState` mutations are dispatched on the EDT via invokeLater (review fix C1). Persistence decision: terminal state is session-only for v1 — restored conversations default to COMPLETED, no schema change (documented in MessageUiModel). Verification: 14 new unit tests (9 ConversationViewModelTest, 5 StreamingResponseHandlerTest); full suite green except the pre-existing ReadFileToolExecutorTest failure also present on clean master.
