# Create PR Workflow
1. Ensure all changes are on a feature/fix branch (create one if on main/develop)
2. Run the build: `./gradlew build`
3. Run tests: `./gradlew test`
4. If build+tests pass, commit with a conventional commit message
5. Push the branch
6. Create a PR with a descriptive title and body summarizing changes
7. Report the PR URL
